/// A trait for definining a branching strategy (oftentimes utilising a [`VariableSelector`] and a
/// [`ValueSelector`]).
///
/// In general, implementations of this trait define how the search of the solver proceeds (i.e. it
/// controls how the solver determines which part of the search space to explore). It is required
/// that the resulting decision creates a smaller domain for at least 1 of the variables (and more
/// domains can be affected due to subsequent inference). See [`branching`] for
/// example usages.
///
/// If the [`Brancher`] (or any component thereof) is implemented incorrectly then the
/// behaviour of the solver is undefined.
