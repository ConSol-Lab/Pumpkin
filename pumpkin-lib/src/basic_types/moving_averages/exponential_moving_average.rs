// This is an implementation of the exponential moving average as described in the paper "Evaluating
// CDCL Restart Schemes" by Biere and Fr√∂hlich (page 14). The idea is to include a smoothing factor
// to eliminate the strong bias of the first term.
//
// The bias is taken into account as described in the paper, i.e. X_smooth is used instead of X, and
// X_smooth is gradually increased until it reaches X It uses a fixed-point arithmetic rather than
// floating points and includes the bias-smoothing technique.
//
// The formula represented is: G_{i+1} = g_{i}*2^{32-X} + (1 - 2^{-X})*G_{i}, where g_i is the i-th
// term, G_i is the value after i terms, and X is the parameter Note that, essentially, the
// upper/lower 32 bits are used as the value before/after the decimal point It includes a smoothing
// factor to eliminate the strong bias of the first term. This is done as described in the paper,
// i.e. X_smooth is used instead of X, and X_smooth is gradually increased until it reaches X

// todo reevaluate this implementation
