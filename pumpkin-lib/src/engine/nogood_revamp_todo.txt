* Learned nogood management.
* Restart policy before took into account number of assigned literals, now it might not?
* Implementation of the nogood propagator is basic.
* proof logging is done by the nogood propagator?
* Nogood propagator could implement the Propagator trait -> could simplify the main propagation loop!
* Remove allow dead code directives
* Later on remove all SAT code / references / deadcode.
* Rename the nogood analysers / new structs.
* Add comments? E.g., the ResolutionNogoodConflictAnalyser uses // but should use ///
* Improve implementation across the board (propagation of nogood? the way they are passed/stored? conflict analysis algorithm?)
* Readd clause minimisation?
* Do proper lazy?
