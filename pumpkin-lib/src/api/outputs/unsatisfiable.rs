    /// Extract an unsatisfiable core in terms of the assumptions.
    ///
    /// In general, a core is a (sub)set of the constraints which together are unsatisfiable; in the
    /// case of constraint programming, this means a set of constraints which are together
    /// unsatisfiable; for example, if we have one variable `x ∈ [0, 10]` and we have the two
    /// constraints `5 * x >= 25` and `[x <= 4]` then it can be observed that these constraints can
    /// never be true at the same time.
    ///
    /// In an assumption-based solver, a core is defined as a (sub)set of assumptions which, given a
    /// set of constraints, when set together will lead to an unsatisfiable instance. For
    /// example, if we have three variables `x, y, z ∈ {0, 1, 2}` and we have the constraint
    /// `all-different(x, y, z)` then the assumptions `[[x = 1], [y <= 1], [y != 0]]` would
    /// constitute an unsatisfiable core since the constraint and the assumptions can never be
    /// satisfied at the same time.
    ///
    /// One of the main examples in which this assumption interface is used is MaxSAT in which
    /// core-guided solvers generate multiple cores while to solve the instance \[1\]. This
    /// core-guided search technique has been translated to CP in \[2\].

    /// # use pumpkin_lib::Solver;

    /// # use pumpkin_lib::termination::Indefinite;
    /// # use pumpkin_lib::predicate;
    /// # use pumpkin_lib::constraints;
    /// # use pumpkin_lib::constraints::Constraint;

    /// let mut solver = Solver::default();

    /// // We create 3 variables with domains within the range [0, 10]
    /// let x = solver.new_bounded_integer(0, 2);
    /// let y = solver.new_bounded_integer(0, 2);
    /// let z = solver.new_bounded_integer(0, 2);
    ///
    /// // We create the all-different constraint
    /// solver.add_constraint(constraints::all_different(vec![x, y, z])).post();
