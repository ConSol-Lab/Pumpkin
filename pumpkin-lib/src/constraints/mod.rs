//! Defines the constraints that Pumpkin provides out of the box which can be added to the
//! [`Solver`].
//!
//! A constraint is a relation over variables. In the solver, constraints are enforced through
//! propagators, and therefore constraints can be viewed as a collection of propagators.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```
//! # use pumpkin_lib::constraints;
//! # use pumpkin_lib::Solver;
//! let mut solver = Solver::default();
//!
//! let a = solver.new_bounded_integer(0, 3);
//! let b = solver.new_bounded_integer(0, 3);
//!
//! solver.add_constraint(constraints::equals([a, b], 0)).post();
//! ```
//!
//! # Note
//! At the moment, the API for posting propagators is not yet publicly accessible as it is
//! unstable. Consumers of the Pumpkin library can therefore only define constraints by
//! decomposing them into the constraints that are predefined in the library. Once the
//! propagator API is stabilized, it will become part of the public API.
